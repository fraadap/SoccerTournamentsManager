is a website presented for the state diploma exam. Allows you to organize football championships of N teams. Users can sign up to the platform and have their team join an existing tournament. Once the number N of teams has been reached, a calendar is drawn up based on various settings (e.g. no more than 3 matches per day or matches only on weekends). Once the calendar is generated, the results of the games played can be recorded, this updates a dynamic ranking and updates the statistics (goals scored, conceded, games won, lost and drawn) represented via a pie chart
